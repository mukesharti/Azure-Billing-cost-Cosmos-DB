To optimize costs in your Azure serverless architecture, given that it's read-heavy and data older than three months is rarely accessed, here’s a cost-effective and scalable strategy to manage your Cosmos DB billing records:

🔍 Problem Recap
Large volume of data in Cosmos DB (>2M records, ~300KB each).

Read-heavy access pattern.

Old data rarely accessed, but must still be available within seconds.

Serverless environment—cost-effective compute is already a priority.

✅ Recommended Architecture for Cost Optimization
1. Tiered Storage Strategy
Move rarely accessed data (older than 3 months) to lower-cost storage, but keep it accessible.

🧊 Cold Tier: Azure Blob Storage (Hot or Cool Tier)
Move older records (e.g., >3 months) from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage, preferably in Cool tier for lower storage costs.

Store records as compressed JSON or parquet files, organized by time-based folders (e.g., /year/month).

🔥 Hot Tier: Azure Cosmos DB
Keep only recent records (≤3 months) in Cosmos DB for fast access and real-time processing.

2. Data Movement & Automation
🛠️ Use Azure Data Factory or Durable Functions
Set up a scheduled pipeline or Durable Function to:

Query records older than 3 months.

Store them in Blob Storage.

Delete from Cosmos DB after successful archival.

3. Access Layer (API) Changes
You need to ensure the application/API can retrieve data from both tiers seamlessly.

🔄 Smart Retrieval Logic
First query Cosmos DB.

If not found, fallback to querying Blob Storage.

You can use Azure Functions or API Management as a facade that abstracts this dual-source retrieval logic.

4. Optional: Indexing & Metadata Store
To speed up lookups in Blob Storage:

🗂️ Lightweight Index in Azure Table Storage or Cosmos DB
Store a small metadata record per archived item: ID, blob location, timestamp, etc.

Keep this index in Cosmos DB or Azure Table Storage (much cheaper for this kind of lightweight data).

5. Access Latency Requirement
Reading a blob from Azure Storage usually takes under 1–2 seconds, especially from the Hot or Cool tier.

Use Azure CDN or enable read caching for more predictable response times if latency becomes variable.

💰 Cost Savings Breakdown

Component	Cost Impact	Notes
Cosmos DB	🔻 Reduced by 60–80%	Fewer RU/s and storage costs.
Azure Blob Storage (Cool)	🟰 Low cost	~$0.01 per GB/month (vs Cosmos DB’s ~$0.25–0.30).
Durable Functions / Data Factory	⚖️ Minimal	Serverless and event-driven = efficient.
Index Store (optional)	🟰 Very low	Azure Table Storage is inexpensive.
🧪 Example Setup
Cosmos DB Container: billing-records-hot

Blob Storage: billing-archive → records/yyyy/mm/dd/billing-id.json

Metadata Table: billing-index (PartitionKey: year-month, RowKey: record-id)

📈 Future Enhancements
Auto-tiering via AI or ML based on access patterns.

Integration with Azure Synapse or ADX for historical analytics.

💰 Cost Optimization Summary

Component	Strategy	Cost Saving Impact
Cosmos DB	Keep only hot data	🔻 Major reduction
Blob Storage	Use cool/archive tiers	💲 Minimal cost
API Layer	Unified access logic	✅ Maintains UX
✅ Meets All Requirements

Requirement	Status	Notes
Simplicity	✅ Easy to build with serverless components	
No Data Loss	✅ Blob storage is durable, Cosmos backup optional	
No Downtime	✅ Archive in background, keep API live	
No API Changes	✅ Unified access layer handles fallback	
Latency for Old Records	✅ Seconds acceptable, can be cached if needed
